# Introduction
The goal of this particular project was to source data on any given subject, polar bear migration in this case, that can be added to a database, and then accessed by the end user to provide visualizations of that data.  One of the major aspects of the project was to build a restful API that allows the end user to call the database in some form, have a flask app query the database, and then return the data back to the html for visualization and consumption.  For our polar project, we chose to deploy the data to a leaflet map to show bear migration patterns, and used python to create charts that show metrics of the bears in the dataset that had the most data points.

# Tools
In order the produce the interactive site, the following tools were used:
- JavaScript
- Leaflet
- Flask
- Python
- The D3 package in JS
- HTML to build the front end for visualization
- Bootstrap and CSS
